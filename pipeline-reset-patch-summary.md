# Pipeline Reset Patch Summary
*Created: 2025-09-04*
*Trigger: Complete architecture overhaul to scene-based rich analysis*

## RESET RATIONALE

**Discovery Impact**: The scene-based rich analysis architecture represents a fundamental shift from basic video processing to comprehensive institutional knowledge platform. This requires complete re-validation of all prior assumptions and decisions.

## ITEMS BEING RE-EXECUTED

### Phase 1: Concept & Validation (All Items Reset)
- **1.1 Brief Ideation**: Value proposition now "scene-by-scene institutional knowledge" vs "basic transcription"
- **1.2 Technical Feasibility**: Processing pipeline completely changed (4x tools, 8-12 min vs 1 min per video)
- **1.3 Similar Codebases**: Need to study scene-based analysis tools, not just basic transcription
- **1.4 Similarities/Differences**: Positioning against rich analysis tools vs basic processors
- **1.5 Architecture Decisions**: Finalize scene-based pipeline vs simple FFmpeg+Whisper

### Phase 2: Foundation & Planning (Items 2.1 Reset)
- **2.1 ASCII Wireframes**: CLI needs scene-based progress, rich analysis configuration options

## NEW ARCHITECTURE SUMMARY

**Scene-Based Rich Analysis Pipeline**:
1. **PySceneDetect** → Split video into scenes
2. **Sequential GPU Processing** → YOLOv8 + EasyOCR + OpenCV per scene  
3. **Parallel Audio Analysis** → Whisper + LibROSA + pyAudioAnalysis full video
4. **Timeline Integration** → Scene-by-scene rich metadata with audio timeline

**New Value Proposition**: Transform marketing video libraries into searchable institutional knowledge with scene-by-scene analysis including objects, people, text, music, speakers, and visual style.

**New Processing Time**: 8-12 minutes per 3-minute video (vs 1 minute) for 10-15x richer output

**New Timeline**: 8-10 weeks development (vs 4 weeks) for comprehensive rich analysis platform

## EXECUTION APPROACH

Starting systematic re-execution from Task 1.1 with the new architecture as foundation. Each task will be properly re-validated through interactive conversation to ensure the enhanced approach is thoroughly validated before proceeding to implementation phases.
