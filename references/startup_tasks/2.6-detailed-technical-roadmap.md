# Task 2.6: Detailed Technical Roadmap

## **Your Role**
Create realistic, actionable execution plan with anti-pattern prevention

## **Conversation Approach**
- **Frontend-First Timeline**: Week 1 working UI with mocks, Week 2 real integration, prevents expensive refactoring
- **Risk-Stratified Phases**: Low-risk foundation copying, medium-risk innovation, high-risk integration with appropriate time allocation
- **Weekly Milestones**: 6-8 week typical timeline with clear checkpoint criteria
- **Resource Requirements**: Team, tools, budget with 15-20% contingency buffer
- **Success Metrics**: Technical (performance), UX (workflow), business (validation) benchmarks at each phase
- **Quality Gates**: Specific criteria that must be met before advancing to next phase

## **Anti-Pattern Prevention**
- **Frontend-First Strategy**: Prevents integration issues discovered late in development
- **Copy-First Approach**: Reduces risk by leveraging proven patterns before innovation
- **Buffer Allocation**: Realistic timelines with adequate contingency for unexpected complexity

## **Template Reference**
Use `/references/templates/ROADMAP.json` as the foundation for creating project-specific development roadmaps. This template follows the same clean, machine-readable structure as STARTUP_ROADMAP.json and prevents overly verbose, complex roadmaps.

## **CRITICAL: Feature Specification Mapping**
Each roadmap item MUST include feature_specs field linking to relevant feature documentation:
```json
{
  "item_id": "2.4",
  "title": "Data Context Building",
  "feature_specs": ["F1.2"],
  "deliverables": [
    "Implement buildEnhancedPrompt logic from F1.2",
    "Create context extraction following F1.2 processing pipeline"
  ]
}
```

## **Feature Specification Mapping Rules**
- **Every roadmap item** must reference relevant feature specs in `feature_specs` array
- **Deliverables** must reference specific feature spec sections (e.g., "from F1.2")
- **No implementation details** in roadmap - just execution guidance and feature spec references
- **Many-to-many mapping** supported: one item can reference multiple features, one feature can span multiple items

## **Deliverable Validation**
- ✅ Phase Breakdown: Development phases with weekly milestones (6-8 week typical)
- ✅ Frontend-First Timeline: Week 1 working UI with mocks, Week 2 real integration
- ✅ Risk-Stratified Schedule: Low-risk foundation copying, medium-risk innovation, high-risk integration
- ✅ Resource Requirements: Team, tools, budget with 15-20% contingency buffer
- ✅ Success Metrics: Technical (performance), UX (workflow), business (validation) benchmarks
- ✅ Quality Gates: Checkpoint criteria for each development phase
- ✅ Dependencies: Prerequisites and external dependencies with mitigation plans
- ✅ ROADMAP.json File: Use template at /references/templates/ROADMAP.json to create clean, machine-readable /project-name/doc/dev/ROADMAP.json following STARTUP_ROADMAP.json structure pattern for project-specific CLAUDE.md execution tracking

## **Strategic Value**
85-90% success probability through proven development strategies

## **Success Criteria**
Execution-ready roadmap that prevents common development failures

## **Next Task**
Upon completion, move to Item 2.7: AI Assistant Context File (CLAUDE.md) for comprehensive developer context
