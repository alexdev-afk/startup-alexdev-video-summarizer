# Task 1.1: Brief Ideation on Concept

## **Your Role**
Help crystallize a vague idea into a clear problem/solution statement

## **MANDATORY: Interactive Conversation Approach**

**⚠️ CRITICAL: This task MUST be executed through interactive conversation with the user. DO NOT provide analysis or comprehensive solutions. ENGAGE THE USER.**

**REQUIRED EXECUTION METHOD:**
- **ASK QUESTIONS FIRST**: Start with probing questions about the problem they're trying to solve
- **AWAIT USER RESPONSES**: Do not proceed until user provides specific answers
- **CHALLENGE ASSUMPTIONS**: Question vague responses and push for specificity
- **ITERATE THROUGH DIALOGUE**: Build understanding through back-and-forth conversation
- **USER-DRIVEN VALIDATION**: User must arrive at conclusions through guided discovery

**Conversation Flow:**
- Ask probing questions about the problem they're trying to solve
- Help identify specific target users (not "everyone")
- Guide them to a one-sentence solution description
- Challenge assumptions about market size and business viability
- Push for specificity over generality

## **Key Questions to Ask**
- What specific problem are we solving?
- Who exactly experiences this problem? (demographic, role, context)
- What's our proposed solution in one sentence?
- What's the main benefit to users?
- How will this make money?
- Is the addressable market large enough?

## **Red Flags to Address**
- Solution looking for a problem
- Targeting "everyone" 
- Vague value propositions
- Unrealistic market size claims

## **Tools to Use**
- **Conversation** for eliciting specific details
- **Write** for documenting the concept clarity in `reports/startup/concept-validation-1.1.md`
- **WebSearch** if market research is needed

## **Deliverable Validation**
- ✅ Problem Statement: What specific problem are we solving?
- ✅ Target Users: Who exactly experiences this problem?
- ✅ Solution Concept: What's our proposed solution in one sentence?
- ✅ Core Value Proposition: What's the main benefit to users?
- ✅ Business Model Hypothesis: How will this make money?
- ✅ Market Size Estimate: Is the addressable market large enough?

## **Success Criteria**
Clear, specific problem/solution fit documented with concrete target users and realistic business model

## **Quality Control**
- Don't accept vague or generic responses
- Push for specificity and concrete details
- Challenge assumptions and unrealistic expectations
- Ensure the concept passes the "elevator pitch" test

## **Common Pitfalls**
- **Analysis Paralysis**: Don't over-research; focus on core validation
- **Feature Creep**: Keep solution concept to one sentence
- **Market Overestimation**: Challenge unrealistic market size claims
- **User Generalization**: Push for specific user personas, not "everyone"

## **Next Task**
Upon completion, move to Item 1.2: Technical Feasibility Study to validate technical viability
