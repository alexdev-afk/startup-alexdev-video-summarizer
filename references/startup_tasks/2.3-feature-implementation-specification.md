# Task 2.3: Feature & Implementation Specification

## **Your Role**
Create implementation blueprint through interactive architectural decision-making based on validated UX patterns and proven technical constraints from Items 2.1 and 2.2

## **CRITICAL: Foundation Review Protocol**
**BEFORE starting this task, ALWAYS:**
1. **Read ALL startup reports** in `/reports/startup/` directory to understand complete validated foundation
2. **Review roadmap progress** in STARTUP_ROADMAP.json for context continuity
3. **Load validated constraints** from prior task completion notes
4. **Understand proven architecture** from Items 1.1-2.2 before making any new decisions

**Why This Matters**: Task 2.3 builds on ALL prior validation work. Skipping foundation review leads to architectural decisions that contradict proven constraints and validated UX patterns.

## **Multi-Context Task Management Protocol**
- **Create Temporal TODO.md**: Project-specific TODO.md file to track subtask progress across context resets
- **Context Reset Strategy**: Recommend context reset after each major subtask completion to maintain focus and performance
- **Progress Persistence**: Use TODO.md to maintain subtask status between sessions, ensuring no work is lost or duplicated

## **Interactive Architecture Approach**
- **Collaborative Decision Making**: Present architectural decisions to user for discussion and approval before finalizing
- **Options Presentation**: Provide multiple technical approaches with trade-offs clearly explained
- **User Validation Required**: No major architectural decisions finalized without explicit user agreement
- **Iterative Refinement**: Allow user feedback to refine architectural choices before implementation specification

## **What to Document**
- **Technical Constraint Integration**: All specifications must reflect proven constraints from ASCII wireframes (2.1) and interactive mock (2.2) validation
- **Complete Feature Specification**: Every user-facing feature fully defined with error handling workflows
- **Validated UX Design**: Interface specifications based on tested wireframes and interactive mock validation
- **Technical Architecture**: Production-ready code examples, service patterns, security framework built-in
- **Integration Specifications**: Platform-specific hooks, API contracts, data processing patterns with working examples
- **Frontend-First Implementation**: Mock-to-real strategy with progressive enhancement approach
- **Security by Design**: Enterprise-grade protection designed into architecture from start, not afterthought
- **Business Model Alignment**: Ensure all technical decisions consistently support revenue model

## **Deliverable Validation**
- ✅ Multi-Context Task Management: Create temporal TODO.md to track subtask progress across context resets
- ✅ Interactive Architecture Sessions: Present architectural decisions to user for discussion and approval before finalizing
- ✅ Features Overview: /project-name/doc/arch/features.md overview document with feature summary and navigation
- ✅ Individual Feature Specifications: /project-name/doc/arch/features/ directory with individual feature specification files
- ✅ Complete Feature Specification: Every user-facing feature fully defined with workflows in separate files
- ✅ User Experience Design: Detailed interface mockups, error handling, professional workflow design
- ✅ Technical Architecture: Production-ready code examples, service patterns, security framework
- ✅ Integration Specifications: Platform-specific hooks, API contracts, data processing patterns
- ✅ Frontend-First Implementation: Mock-to-real strategy with progressive enhancement approach
- ✅ Security by Design: Enterprise-grade protection designed into architecture from start
- ✅ Business Model Alignment: Technical decisions consistently support revenue model

## **Quality Criteria**
- **Validation-Based**: All specifications reflect proven technical constraints from Items 2.1 and 2.2
- **Implementation Ready**: Developer can begin immediately with 95%+ execution confidence
- **Complete Coverage**: Every technical decision made, no architectural uncertainty remaining
- **Production Quality**: Code examples are copy-paste ready for immediate use
- **Strategic Alignment**: Technical approach supports business goals and competitive positioning
- **User-Approved**: All major architectural decisions explicitly approved by user through interactive sessions

## **Success Criteria**
Complete implementation blueprint with minimal unknowns or architectural uncertainty, validated through interactive architectural decision-making

## **Next Task**
Upon completion, move to Item 2.4: Create Project Skeleton for actual project structure creation
