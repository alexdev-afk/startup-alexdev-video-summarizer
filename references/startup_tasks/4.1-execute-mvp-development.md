# Task 4.1: Execute MVP Development

## **Your Role**
Execute the planned MVP development in phases

## **Development Phases**
Execute systematic development following the detailed technical roadmap created in Item 2.6

## **Typical Timeline Structure**
- **Week 1-2 Foundation**: Plugin scaffold creation, Settings page implementation, API integration, Basic security measures
- **Week 3-4 Core Processing**: Data extraction, AI context generation, Response validation, Update system
- **Week 5-6 Integration**: UI implementation, AJAX request handling, Live updates, User experience polish
- **Week 7-8 Testing & Launch**: Compatibility testing, Bug fixes and optimization, Documentation completion, Beta user testing

## **Development Strategy**
- **Frontend-First Approach**: Working UI with mocks first, then real integration
- **Copy-First Implementation**: Leverage proven patterns from reference analysis
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Build core functionality first, add enhancements incrementally
- **Quality Gates**: Meet checkpoint criteria before advancing phases

## **Deliverable Validation**
- ✅ Week 1-2 Foundation: Plugin scaffold creation, Settings page implementation, API integration, Basic security measures
- ✅ Week 3-4 Core Processing: Data extraction, AI context generation, Response validation, Update system
- ✅ Week 5-6 Integration: UI implementation, AJAX request handling, Live updates, User experience polish
- ✅ Week 7-8 Testing & Launch: Compatibility testing, Bug fixes and optimization, Documentation completion, Beta user testing

## **Success Criteria**
Fully functional MVP ready for user validation and feedback

## **Development Context Switch**
Upon starting this phase, switch to using the project-specific CLAUDE.md and ROADMAP.json files created in Phase 2 for detailed execution guidance.

## **Quality Assurance**
- Follow all testing procedures defined in operational documentation
- Meet performance benchmarks defined in technical roadmap
- Validate against success criteria from pre-development checklist
- Conduct beta user testing before launch

## **Completion Criteria**
MVP meets all defined success criteria and is ready for user deployment and feedback collection
