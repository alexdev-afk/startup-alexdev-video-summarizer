# Task 2.7: AI Assistant Context File (CLAUDE.md)

## **Your Role**
Create comprehensive context for future Claude instances (this is critical for project success)

## **CRITICAL: Developer Git Protocol Integration**
When creating the developer CLAUDE.md context, you MUST include the git commit protocol prominently:

```markdown
### **MANDATORY: Git Commit Protocol**
**As a developer Claude instance, you MUST follow these commit rules:**

**YOUR ROADMAP**: Read `doc/dev/ROADMAP.json` for current development status and next tasks. Never access `../STARTUP_ROADMAP.json` - that's for planning context only.

**Developer Context Commits - YOU ARE HERE:**
- **Commit Prefix**: `dev(scope): [description]`  
- **Working Directory**: Project directory ([project-name]/)
- **Examples**:
  ```bash
  git commit -m "dev(core): Implement service container architecture"
  git commit -m "dev(ui): Create chatbot overlay components"  
  git commit -m "dev(api): Add Gemini provider integration"
  git commit -m "dev(test): Add unit tests for container pattern"
  git commit -m "dev(docs): Update implementation progress"
  ```

**Scope Guidelines**: core, ui, api, test, config, deploy, docs, fix, feat, refactor

**Why This Protocol Matters**:
- Distinguishes development commits from planning commits (`plan(scope)`)
- Enables clear project history tracking across validation and execution phases
- Required for proper project governance and progress tracking
```

## **CRITICAL: Documentation Authority Hierarchy**
When creating developer CLAUDE.md, you MUST establish clear documentation precedence:

```markdown
## **CRITICAL: Documentation Hierarchy**
**Follow this order when conflicts arise:**

1. **Feature Specifications** (`doc/arch/features/*.md`) - WHAT to build
   - Authoritative for all functionality details
   - Contains validated UX patterns and technical approaches
   - Referenced in roadmap items via `feature_specs` field

2. **Development Roadmap** (`doc/dev/ROADMAP.json`) - WHEN/HOW to build
   - Authoritative for execution order and deliverables
   - Links to relevant feature specs via `feature_specs` arrays
   - Your primary task management tool

3. **This CLAUDE.md** - HOW to navigate documentation
   - Provides context and guidance only
   - Does NOT contain implementation details
   - Points you to authoritative sources

**When Implementation Conflicts Arise:**
- Feature Specs override all other sources
- Roadmap provides execution guidance only
- CLAUDE.md provides navigation help only
```

## **What to Include**
- **Git Commit Protocol**: MANDATORY developer commit rules (see above)
- **Documentation Hierarchy**: MANDATORY authority structure (see above)
- **Project Overview**: Complete background, value proposition, target users, business model
- **Technical Architecture**: Service patterns, proven implementations, copy/adapt/extend decisions (HIGH-LEVEL ONLY)
- **Development Strategy**: Frontend-first approach, anti-pattern prevention, risk mitigation strategies
- **Code Standards**: Platform-specific guidelines, security practices, performance requirements
- **Integration Requirements**: External APIs, platform hooks, data processing patterns (NO detailed examples - reference feature specs)
- **Domain Knowledge**: Business logic, user workflows, success metrics, market positioning
- **Business Context**: Market positioning, competitive landscape, business model alignment
- **Meta-Learning**: Framework improvement opportunities and process insights

## **What NOT to Include**
- ❌ **Detailed Implementation Examples**: These belong in feature specifications
- ❌ **Production Code Examples**: These cause conflicts with feature specs
- ❌ **Copy-paste ready code**: Reference feature specs instead
- ❌ **Specific API calls or functions**: Point to feature specifications

## **Deliverable Validation**
- ✅ Project Overview: Complete background, value proposition, target users, business model
- ✅ Technical Architecture: Service patterns, proven implementations, copy/adapt/extend decisions
- ✅ Development Strategy: Frontend-first approach, anti-pattern prevention, risk mitigation strategies
- ✅ Code Standards: Platform-specific guidelines, security practices, performance requirements
- ✅ Integration Requirements: External APIs, platform hooks, data processing patterns with working examples
- ✅ Domain Knowledge: Business logic, user workflows, success metrics, market positioning
- ✅ Production Code Examples: Copy-paste ready implementations for immediate AI productivity
- ✅ Business Context: Market positioning, competitive landscape, business model alignment

## **Quality Criteria**
- **Git Protocol Compliance**: Developer commit rules prominently documented and enforced
- **Documentation Navigation**: Clear hierarchy and authority structure established
- **Context Rich**: 6k+ words of strategic context without implementation conflicts
- **Authority Clear**: No ambiguity about which source to follow for implementation details
- **Reference Based**: Points to authoritative sources rather than duplicating them

## **Strategic Value**
15-20% development acceleration + elimination of specification conflicts + clear authority structure

## **Success Criteria**
Strategic AI assistant context with clear documentation authority that eliminates specification conflicts

## **Next Task**
Upon completion, Phase 2 is complete. Move to Phase 3: Execution Readiness starting with Item 3.1: Pre-Development Checklist
