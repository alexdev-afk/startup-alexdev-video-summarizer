# Task 2.2: Interactive Mock using Tech Stack

## **Your Role**
Build working HTML/CSS/JavaScript prototype using project tech stack for hands-on UI validation

## **Conversation Approach**
- Create interactive HTML mockup with platform-specific styling
- Implement working form components with proper states
- Simulate API interactions with realistic delays/responses
- Demonstrate error handling and success flows
- Provide component extraction guide for production implementation

## **Tools to Use**
- **Write** for creating HTML/CSS/JavaScript files in `/references/2.2-interactive-mock-tech-stack/`
- **Platform-specific styling** (WordPress admin, Chrome extension, etc.)
- **Mock API responses** with realistic data and delays

## **Interactive Components to Build**
- Fully functional forms with validation
- Button interactions with loading states
- Simulated API calls with progress indicators
- Error handling with user-friendly messages
- Success confirmations with next actions

## **Technical Requirements**
- Use the project's actual tech stack
- Platform-appropriate styling and UI patterns
- Realistic response times and loading states
- Proper error handling and edge cases
- Mobile-responsive if applicable

## **File Organization**
**Mock Project Structure**:
```
references/2.2-interactive-mock-tech-stack/
├── index.html (main health dashboard)
├── style.css (dashboard styling)
├── script.js (interactions and mock API)
├── assets/ (images, icons if needed)
└── README.md (how to run and test)
```

## **Deliverable Validation**
- ✅ Interactive HTML mockup with platform styling
- ✅ Working form components (inputs, buttons, loading states)
- ✅ Simulated API interactions with realistic delays/responses
- ✅ Error handling and success flow demonstrations
- ✅ Component extraction guide for production implementation
- ✅ Mock project organized in `/references/2.2-interactive-mock-tech-stack/`
- ✅ Completion report in `/reports/startup/interactive-mock-2.2.md`

## **Success Criteria**
Working prototype that validates complete user workflow with realistic interactions

## **Mock Implementation Strategy**
- Start with static HTML structure
- Add CSS styling matching target platform
- Implement JavaScript for interactions
- Add mock API responses with setTimeout
- Test all user flows and edge cases

## **Component Extraction Documentation**
Document how to extract working components:
- Which HTML structures to reuse
- CSS classes and styling patterns
- JavaScript interaction patterns
- API integration points
- State management approach

## **Completion Report Requirements**
Document in `/reports/startup/interactive-mock-2.2.md`:
- **Mock validation results**: What UI flows were tested and validated
- **Component extraction guide**: How to use mock components in production
- **User experience findings**: What worked well, what needs adjustment
- **Technical implementation notes**: Key patterns for production development
- **File organization summary**: What was created and where to find it

## **Next Task**
Upon completion, move to Item 2.3: Feature & Implementation Specification for detailed technical planning
