# High-Fidelity ASCII Mockup Brief Template

**Purpose**: Institutionalized methodology for Trinity UI Communication capability demonstration  
**Context**: For high-stakes architectural rescue scenarios where UI accuracy is mission-critical  
**Success Model**: Based on V7 achievement of 99% accuracy on complex Flutter application rescue

---

## **Phase 1: Initial Brief & Context Setting**

### **Background Context Template**
```
We've attempted [previous approach description - e.g., "conceptual-only wireframes, code-structure analysis, etc."] 
and haven't achieved the fidelity needed for [project goal - e.g., "architectural rescue/enhancement work"]. 

We're ready for the upgraded Trinity approach that combines:
- Visual Reality (screenshots/visual evidence)  
- Code Structure (implementation analysis)
- Conceptual Framework (hierarchy patterns)

This is a pivotal capability demonstration that will determine how we proceed with [enhancement work type].
```

### **Trinity UI Communication Methodology** 
*(Embedded - no external lesson dependency)*

**The Problem**: Each source alone creates dangerous hallucinations
- **Code Structure Alone**: Correct architecture, fictional UX data
- **Visual Reality Alone**: Correct appearance, wrong architectural assumptions  
- **Conceptual Framework Alone**: Clean ideals, implementation impossibilities

**The Solution**: Trinity validates and corrects
- **Visual Reality** (Primary): Prevents fictional data/layout hallucinations
- **Code Structure** (Secondary): Prevents architectural misconceptions  
- **Conceptual Framework** (Tertiary): Prevents implementation chaos

**Success Requirement**: All three sources synchronized = 99%+ accuracy possible

### **Evidence Gathering Protocol**
```
BEFORE starting any wireframe work:

1. Read all startup task reports in /reports/startup/  
2. Read the UI hierarchy patterns in /references/[project]/ui-hierarchy-patterns.md
3. Check all screenshots in /references/screenshots/
4. Read implementation code from /references/[project]/[frontend-path]/
5. THEN ask clarification questions before proceeding
```

## **Phase 2: Critical Clarification Conversation**

### **Mandatory Clarification Topics**

#### **Scope & Fidelity Approach**
**AI Must Ask**: "Can you propose a method statement for scope and fidelity toward these targets?"

**Key Clarifications Needed**:
- Layout precision level (pixel-perfect vs conceptual)
- Text handling approach (exact reproduction vs summarization)  
- Data source priority (screenshots vs code vs assumptions)
- Enhancement boundary (pure replication vs architectural comments)

#### **Dimensional & Output Specifications**  
**AI Must Ask**: "What are the dimensional constraints and output organization?"

**Key Clarifications Needed**:
- ASCII canvas dimensions (width × height)
- Monospace font requirements
- File organization structure
- Screen coverage priorities

#### **Capability Demonstration Boundaries**
**AI Must Ask**: "Should this include any architectural enhancements or focus purely on understanding demonstration?"

**Key Clarifications Needed**:
- New features to avoid (write-lock modals, loading states, etc.)
- Architectural comments inclusion/exclusion
- Real vs placeholder data requirements
- Success criteria and grade targets

---

## **Phase 3: Method Statement Development**

### **Scope & Fidelity Targets Framework**
Template for final method statement:

✅ **LAYOUT**: [Precision level - e.g., "Precise spatial relationships, component positioning"]  
✅ **HIERARCHY**: [Framework pattern - e.g., "App → Nav → Screen → Header → Sidebar → Selector → Content"]  
✅ **REAL DATA**: [Data approach - e.g., "Faithful reproduction, no fictional content"]  
✅ **TEXT FIDELITY**: [Text handling - e.g., "Full text when space allows, ellipses when constrained"]  
✅ **NO ENHANCEMENTS**: [Enhancement boundary - e.g., "Pure understanding demonstration"]

### **Trinity Evidence Integration Protocol**
1. **Visual Reality (Screenshots)**: Primary source for layout, spacing, real data, visual hierarchy
2. **Code Structure**: Secondary validation for component relationships, naming accuracy  
3. **Conceptual Framework**: Tertiary guide for hierarchy pattern classification

### **Screen Coverage Plan**
Based on available evidence, creating wireframes for:
- **[Screen Type 1]** ([evidence-files])
- **[Screen Type 2]** ([evidence-files])
- **[Screen Type 3]** ([evidence-files])

### **Quality Validation Criteria**
- **Layout Accuracy**: Component positions match visual evidence spatial relationships
- **Text Fidelity**: Real [data-types] names, actual metrics, exact labels
- **Hierarchy Clarity**: Framework pattern understanding demonstration
- **Monospace Alignment**: Perfect ASCII box-drawing character alignment
- **No Innovation**: Zero architectural enhancements or new features

## **Phase 4: Execution Specifications**

### **Dimensional Specifications**
- **Optimal**: 220 characters width × 50 lines height (wide dashboard layouts)
- **Alternative**: 200 characters width × 70 lines height (taller content)  
- **Display**: Monospace font required (Courier New, Consolas, Monaco)

### **Trinity Source Requirements**

#### **Visual Reality Sources**
- **Location**: `/references/screenshots/*.png`
- **Coverage**: All screen states, UI variations, real data examples
- **Priority**: Primary source - prevents most dangerous hallucinations

#### **Code Structure Sources** 
- **Location**: `/references/[project]/[frontend-path]/`

- **Priority**: Secondary validation - prevents architectural misconceptions

#### **Conceptual Framework Sources**
- **Location**: `/references/[project]/ui-hierarchy-patterns.md`
- **Framework**: Standardized hierarchy classification
- **Priority**: Tertiary organization - prevents implementation chaos

## **Template Usage Protocol**

### **When to Use This Template**
- Previous wireframe attempts achieved <90% accuracy
- Enhancement work planned requiring high UI fidelity foundation
- Complex UI with multiple screens/patterns requiring systematic approach
- Trinity evidence sources available (Visual + Code + Conceptual)

### **Critical Success Dependencies**
- **Human-AI Conversation**: Template guides discussion, doesn't replace it
- **Evidence Completeness**: All three Trinity sources must be available
- **Iterative Refinement**: Brief emerges through clarification, not imposition
- **Capability-First Mindset**: Understanding demonstration before enhancement

### **Common Failure Patterns to Avoid**
- Skipping clarification conversation (leads to assumption-based failures)
- Using single or binary evidence sources (creates persistent hallucinations)
- Attempting enhancement during capability demonstration (scope confusion)
- Accepting <99% accuracy for high-stakes rescue scenarios (inadequate foundation)

**This methodology achieved 99% accuracy on complex Flutter application rescue - use complete process for similar high-fidelity requirements.**
