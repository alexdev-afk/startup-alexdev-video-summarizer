# Task 2.5: Operational Documentation & Runbooks

## **Your Role**
Create comprehensive operational documentation for development and deployment

## **What to Document**
- **Development Runbook**: Complete environment setup, development workflow, debugging procedures
- **Build & Deployment Procedures**: Build pipeline processes, artifact management workflows, deployment packaging procedures (directory structure created in 2.4)
- **Deployment Runbook**: Installation steps, configuration management, troubleshooting guide
- **Architecture Documentation**: System design, component interactions, data flow, extension points
- **Emergency Procedures**: Incident response, rollback procedures, data recovery processes
- **Maintenance Procedures**: Regular maintenance tasks, monitoring, performance optimization
- **Quality Assurance**: Testing procedures, code quality gates, release validation

## **Conversation Approach**
- Plan operational documentation structure based on project architecture
- Identify all scenarios requiring documented procedures
- Create templates for recurring operational tasks
- Define monitoring and alerting requirements
- Plan incident response and recovery procedures

## **Deliverable Validation**
- ✅ Development Runbook: Complete development environment setup, workflow, debugging guide
- ✅ Build & Deployment Procedures: Build pipeline processes, artifact management workflows, deployment packaging procedures
- ✅ Deployment Runbook: Installation, configuration, troubleshooting, monitoring procedures
- ✅ Architecture Documentation: System design, component interactions, data flow, extension points
- ✅ Maintenance Procedures: Regular maintenance tasks, performance monitoring, update processes
- ✅ Quality Assurance: Testing procedures, code quality gates, release validation
- ✅ Emergency Procedures: Incident response, rollback procedures, data recovery processes

## **Quality Criteria**
- **Complete Coverage**: All operational scenarios documented
- **Step-by-Step**: Procedures clear enough for any team member to follow
- **Emergency Ready**: Incident response procedures tested and validated
- **Maintenance Friendly**: Regular maintenance tasks clearly defined

## **Success Criteria**
Complete operational readiness with documented procedures for all scenarios

## **Next Task**
Upon completion, move to Item 2.6: Detailed Technical Roadmap for execution planning
