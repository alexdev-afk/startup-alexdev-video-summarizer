# Task 1.2: Technical Feasibility Study

## **Your Role**
Technical due diligence to prevent building impossible things

## **MANDATORY: Interactive Conversation Approach**

**⚠️ CRITICAL: This task MUST be executed through interactive conversation with the user. DO NOT provide solo technical analysis. ENGAGE THE USER.**

**REQUIRED EXECUTION METHOD:**
- **ASK ABOUT REQUIREMENTS FIRST**: Identify core technical requirements through user discussion
- **COLLABORATIVE EVALUATION**: Research technologies together with user input on preferences
- **USER CONSTRAINT GATHERING**: Understand user technical preferences and limitations
- **RISK TOLERANCE DISCUSSION**: Get user input on acceptable risk levels and trade-offs
- **ITERATIVE VALIDATION**: Build technical understanding through back-and-forth dialogue

**Conversation Flow:**
- Identify core technical requirements and constraints
- Research and evaluate necessary technologies/APIs/platforms
- Assess integration complexity realistically
- Identify performance and scalability requirements
- Highlight highest technical risks
- Provide honest timeline estimates
- Give percentage probability of technical success

## **Tools to Use**
- **WebSearch** for technology research
- **WebFetch** for API documentation
- **Your technical knowledge** for architecture assessment

## **Research Areas**
- What technologies/APIs/platforms are needed?
- Are these technologies mature and well-supported?
- What are the integration complexity challenges?
- What performance constraints must be met?
- What scale must the solution handle?
- Are there any technical blockers or unknowns?

## **Red Flags to Address**
- Unrealistic technical expectations
- Dependence on unproven/unavailable technologies
- Underestimating integration complexity
- No consideration of scale or performance

## **Deliverable Validation**
- ✅ Core Technical Requirements: What are the must-have technical capabilities?
- ✅ Technology Stack Assessment: What technologies/APIs/platforms are needed?
- ✅ Integration Complexity: How complex are the required integrations?
- ✅ Performance Requirements: What are the performance constraints?
- ✅ Scalability Needs: What scale must the solution handle?
- ✅ Risk Assessment: What are the highest technical risks?
- ✅ Timeline Estimate: Rough estimate of development time
- ✅ Success Probability: Overall technical feasibility (%)

## **Success Criteria**
Technical feasibility confirmed (80%+ confidence) with risk mitigation plan

## **Risk Assessment Framework**
- **High Risk**: Unproven technologies, complex integrations, performance unknowns
- **Medium Risk**: Mature technologies with known challenges
- **Low Risk**: Well-established patterns with proven implementations

## **Timeline Estimation Guidelines**
- Factor in learning curves for new technologies
- Add buffer time for integration challenges
- Consider team experience level
- Account for testing and debugging time

## **Next Task**
Upon completion, move to Item 1.3: Study of Similar Professional-Grade Codebase to learn proven patterns
