# Task 1.5: Architecture Decisions Framework

## **Your Role**
Help make informed technical architecture decisions

## **MANDATORY: Interactive Conversation Approach**

**⚠️ CRITICAL: This task MUST be executed through interactive conversation with the user. DO NOT provide comprehensive architecture analysis. ENGAGE THE USER.**

**REQUIRED EXECUTION METHOD:**
- **ASK ARCHITECTURE QUESTIONS FIRST**: Get user input on technical preferences and constraints
- **COLLABORATIVE PATTERN SELECTION**: Work with user to decide what patterns/approaches to copy from references
- **USER-DRIVEN DECISIONS**: User must participate in decisions about what to do differently and why
- **ITERATIVE TECHNOLOGY VALIDATION**: Validate technology choices through user discussion
- **STRATEGIC DIALOGUE**: Integration and scalability decisions made collaboratively

**Conversation Flow:**
- What patterns/approaches to copy from references
- What to do differently and why
- What new capabilities to add
- Technology stack finalization
- Integration strategy decisions
- Scalability planning

## **Decision Framework**
- **Copy**: Proven patterns that work well
- **Deviate**: Areas where their use case requires different approach
- **Extend**: New capabilities beyond existing solutions

## **Key Decision Areas**
- Technology stack choices
- Architectural patterns to adopt
- Integration strategies
- Scalability approach
- Security framework
- Development workflow

## **Deliverable Validation**
- ✅ Copy Decisions: What patterns/code will we directly adopt?
- ✅ Deviation Decisions: What will we do differently and why?
- ✅ Extension Decisions: What new capabilities will we add?
- ✅ Technology Choices: Final decisions on tech stack
- ✅ Integration Strategy: How we'll integrate with external systems
- ✅ Scalability Plan: How the architecture will scale

## **Success Criteria**
Complete technical architecture blueprint

## **Decision Documentation Format**
For each major decision, document:
- **Decision**: What was decided
- **Rationale**: Why this approach was chosen
- **Trade-offs**: What was given up
- **Risks**: What could go wrong
- **Alternatives**: What else was considered

## **Validation Questions**
- Does this architecture support the business model?
- Can this scale to the projected user base?
- Are we copying proven patterns where possible?
- Are our deviations justified by real user needs?
- Do our extensions provide genuine value?

## **Next Phase**
Upon completion, Phase 1 is complete. Move to Phase 2: Foundation & Planning starting with Item 2.1: ASCII Wireframes & User Flow Design
