# Task 2.4: Create Project Skeleton

## **Your Role**
Create the actual project structure with directories, files, and operational documentation framework informed by validated specifications

## **Conversation Approach**
- **Create actual directory structure** for their tech stack with placeholder files
- **Create architecture documentation** in `/project/doc/arch/` describing the structure design and rationale
- Establish naming conventions and development environment setup
- Plan version control strategy and development workflow
- Set code standards and security practices with example implementations
- **Create operational documentation structure** (doc/arch/, doc/dev/, doc/sysops/) with content
- **Create completion report** documenting what was created and implementation guidance

## **Critical Process Improvement**
The deliverable is the actual project foundation, not just documentation about it. The report documents completion, not replaces the actual work.

## **Deliverable Validation**
- ✅ Actual Project Directory: Create /project-name/ with complete folder structure and placeholder files
- ✅ Build System Structure: Create /build/, /dist/, /scripts/ directories with proper .gitignore configuration
- ✅ Architecture Documentation: Create /project-name/doc/arch/ with system design documentation
- ✅ Directory Structure: Organized file and folder structure following platform conventions
- ✅ Naming Conventions: Consistent naming standards with examples
- ✅ Development Environment: Local development setup requirements and scripts
- ✅ Version Control: Repository structure and branching strategy
- ✅ Code Standards: Platform-specific coding style and quality guidelines with examples
- ✅ Security Framework: Security practices and requirements with working examples
- ✅ Asset Organization: Frontend assets structure with build configuration
- ✅ Service Architecture: Dependency injection and service patterns with placeholder implementations
- ✅ Operational Documentation: Complete doc/arch/, doc/dev/, doc/sysops/ structure with content
- ✅ Development Reports Structure: /project-name/doc/dev/reports/ directory for development phase completion reports
- ✅ Completion Report: Document what was created and implementation guidance

## **Success Criteria**
Complete project foundation ready for development execution

## **Directory Structure Example**
```
project-name/
├── src/
├── doc/
│   ├── arch/
│   ├── dev/
│   └── sysops/
├── build/
├── dist/
├── scripts/
├── tests/
└── README.md
```

## **Next Task**
Upon completion, move to Item 2.5: Operational Documentation & Runbooks for deployment preparation
