# Breaking Discovery Patch Management
*Created: 2025-09-04*
*Discovery: Enhanced Audio/Video Analysis Requirements*

## Patch Impact Analysis

### Prior Roadmap Items Requiring Re-assessment

#### 1.2 Technical Feasibility Study ❌ NEEDS REVISION
**Current Status**: 99.5% confidence, ~1 minute per video, 4 weeks development
**Impact**: Processing time estimates completely invalid with rich analysis
**Action Required**: Re-evaluate with enhanced tool integration complexity

#### 1.5 Architecture Decisions Framework ❌ NEEDS REVISION  
**Current Status**: Python + FFmpeg + Whisper Large, copy-first approach
**Impact**: Tech stack may need significant expansion (librosa, computer vision tools)
**Action Required**: Decision on simple vs rich analysis pipeline

#### 2.1 ASCII Wireframes ❌ NEEDS REVISION
**Current Status**: Interactive CLI with simple progress display
**Impact**: Progress display, configuration options, metadata structure changes
**Action Required**: Wireframes need enhancement for rich analysis options

#### Future Items (2.3+) ⏸️ ON HOLD
**Status**: Cannot proceed until discovery resolution
**Impact**: All implementation planning depends on architecture decision

### Discovery Resolution Options

#### Option A: Keep Simple (Current Approach)
- ✅ Maintain copy-first strategy, proven tools
- ✅ Keep 4-week timeline and 1-minute processing
- ❌ Limited output richness for institutional knowledge

#### Option B: Add Rich Analysis (Enhanced Approach)  
- ✅ Dramatically improved output value
- ✅ True institutional knowledge capture
- ❌ 5-10x processing time increase
- ❌ Complex multi-tool integration
- ❌ Timeline extension to 8-12 weeks

#### Option C: Two-Phase Approach (Hybrid)
- ✅ Ship simple version quickly (Phase 1: 4 weeks)
- ✅ Add enhancements later (Phase 2: +6 weeks)
- ✅ Validate market need before complexity
- ❌ Two separate development cycles

## Patch Priority

**HIGH PRIORITY** - Core value proposition and technical feasibility affected

### Immediate Actions Required:
1. **User Decision**: Choose Option A, B, or C above
2. **Research Phase**: IF Option B/C chosen, comprehensive tool analysis needed
3. **Roadmap Reset**: Re-execute affected items with new direction
4. **Timeline Re-estimation**: Update all development estimates

### Patch Execution Checklist:
- [ ] User validates discovery and selects option
- [ ] Research enhanced analysis tools (if needed)
- [ ] Re-execute Technical Feasibility (1.2) 
- [ ] Re-execute Architecture Decisions (1.5)
- [ ] Re-execute ASCII Wireframes (2.1)
- [ ] Update all timeline estimates
- [ ] Reset STARTUP_ROADMAP.json completion status for revised items

## Framework Improvement Notes

**Process Gap Identified**: Architecture decisions were made without fully exploring output richness requirements. Future projects should include "output sample analysis" during technical feasibility phase.

**Template Update Needed**: Add output richness evaluation to technical feasibility task guide.
