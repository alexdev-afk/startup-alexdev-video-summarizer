*Temporal TODO.md for multi-context task management*

## Task Status: COMPLETED âœ…
**Current Item**: 2.3 - Feature & Implementation Specification  
**Completion Date**: 2025-09-04  
**Next Item**: 2.4 - Create Project Skeleton

## Validated Foundation (Completed)
âœ… **Item 1.1**: Scene-based institutional knowledge extraction concept validated  
âœ… **Item 1.2**: 7-tool pipeline architecture with 92% technical feasibility confirmed  
âœ… **Item 1.3**: Scene-based processing patterns from 6 production codebases analyzed  
âœ… **Item 1.4**: Strategic positioning as first comprehensive scene-based solution  
âœ… **Item 1.5**: Complete 7-tool integration architecture with copy-first approach  
âœ… **Item 2.1**: Simplified CLI interface with config-driven appliance philosophy  
âœ… **Item 2.2**: Marked N/A - CLI tool fully expressed in ASCII wireframes  

## Key Architecture Constraints (From Foundation)
- **Scene-Based Processing**: 70x performance via representative frame sampling
- **7-Tool Pipeline**: PySceneDetect â†’ YOLOv8 â†’ EasyOCR â†’ OpenCV â†’ WhisperX â†’ LibROSA â†’ pyAudioAnalysis
- **Sequential CUDA**: One GPU service at a time to prevent conflicts
- **Service Architecture**: venv isolation per tool with shared scene context
- **CLI Interface**: 3-screen workflow (Launch â†’ Processing â†’ Complete â†’ Claude synthesis)
- **Output Structure**: build/ (artifacts) + output/ (final .md knowledge files)

## Interactive Session Notes

### Architecture Decisions Confirmed:
âœ… **Enhanced Dual-Pipeline per Scene**: GPU pipeline (YOLOv8 â†’ EasyOCR sequential) + CPU pipeline (PySceneDetect â†’ OpenCV â†’ Audio tools sequential) running in parallel per scene
âœ… **Fail-Fast with Circuit Breaker**: Stop processing video on any tool failure, abort entire batch after 3 consecutive video failures  
âœ… **Static YAML Configuration**: Ultra-simple appliance approach with pre-configured settings
âœ… **Single Knowledge File per Video**: One comprehensive .md file per video in output/
âœ… **Manual Claude Handoff**: CLI completion message for manual synthesis todo creation
âœ… **Hybrid MVP Development**: Progressive tool integration with early validation

### Development Sequence Planning: REVISED
âœ… **User-Corrected Tool Order**: FFmpeg foundation (video/audio separation) â†’ Whisper + YOLO (fully functional baseline) â†’ PySceneDetect â†’ Audio pipeline â†’ Remaining video pipeline

## Context Reset Checkpoints
- [ ] After Interactive Architecture session (recommend reset before Feature Overview)
- [ ] After Features Overview creation (recommend reset before Individual Specs)
- [ ] After Individual Feature Specs (recommend reset before Technical Architecture)
- [ ] After Technical Architecture (recommend reset before Final Validation)

## Next Session Context
**When resuming**: Read this TODO.md â†’ Continue from current task â†’ Update progress â†’ Mark completed items
**Current Focus**: Interactive architecture session with user for collaborative decision-making
