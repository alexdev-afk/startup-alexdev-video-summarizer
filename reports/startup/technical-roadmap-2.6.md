## **Resource Requirements & Dependencies**

### **Development Resources**
- **Timeline**: 6 weeks with 15% contingency buffer (7 weeks total allocation)
- **Hardware**: RTX 5070 GPU for AI processing, sufficient CPU for parallel audio analysis
- **Team**: Single developer with AI assistant systematic implementation support
- **Storage**: Adequate disk space for build/ intermediate files and output/ knowledge base

### **Critical Dependencies**
- **Foundation Dependency**: FFmpeg must be complete before any AI tool integration
- **GPU Coordination**: Sequential patterns established before adding additional GPU tools  
- **Scene Processing**: Detection accuracy validated before performance optimization
- **Error Framework**: Robust handling needed before production batch processing

### **Mitigation Strategies**
- **FFmpeg Compatibility**: Early testing with diverse video formats during foundation phase
- **GPU Memory Management**: Sequential tool loading validation before full pipeline
- **Scene Detection Accuracy**: Quality validation before performance optimization
- **Error Scenario Coverage**: Testing throughout development, not just at completion

## **Anti-Pattern Prevention**

### **Frontend-First Strategy**
- **Week 1**: Working CLI interface with mocks prevents late UI integration issues
- **Week 2**: Real FFmpeg integration with established UI patterns
- **Risk Reduction**: UI/integration issues discovered early in development cycle

### **Copy-First Innovation**
- **Foundation**: Leverage proven patterns from 6 reference codebases analysis
- **Innovation Layer**: Novel scene-based architecture built on validated foundations
- **Risk Balance**: 80% proven patterns, 20% controlled innovation for differentiation

### **Buffer Allocation**
- **15% Contingency**: Realistic timeline accounting for unexpected complexity
- **Weekly Milestones**: Clear checkpoint criteria prevent scope creep
