# ASCII Wireframes & User Flow Design - Task 2.1 Completion Report

## Overview
Interactive conversation completed for ASCII wireframes and user flow design. Validated interactive CLI approach with comprehensive user journey mapping and error handling flows.

## Deliverables Completed

### ASCII Wireframes Created
**File Location**: `references/mockups/ascii-wireframes/`

**v1-2025-09-04-1445.md** (Initial GUI concept - pivoted)
- Initial GUI mockups for main interface, processing status, video index browser
- Component hierarchy design
- Identified mismatch with runbook-driven architecture

**v2-2025-09-04-1450.md** (Final Interactive CLI Design)
- Interactive command-line interface flow with step-by-step prompts
- Batch processing status with real-time progress and non-interrupting error logging
- Video index browser (.md format with ASCII tables)
- Corrected file structure: `output/{video-filename}/` with transcript and frames together
- Error handling: log errors during processing, review at end without interruption

### User Flow Diagrams
**File Location**: `references/mockups/ascii-wireframes/user-flows-2025-09-04-1455.md`

**Primary User Journey (Happy Path)**
- Input validation → Configuration prompts → Uninterrupted batch processing → Results summary
- Non-interrupting design: complete all videos before error review

**Alternative User Paths**
- User cancellation during setup
- User cancellation during configuration  
- Empty input folder handling

**Error Recovery Flows**
- Disk space issues during processing
- Corrupted video file handling
- Whisper transcription failures with partial success

**Edge Case Handling**
- Extremely large video processing
- Audio-only file processing
- Duplicate detection during batch

**Administrative Workflows**
- Retry failed videos only (`--retry-failed`)
- View processing history (`--history`)
- Clean restart with output clearing (`--clean-restart`)

## Component Hierarchy Established

### Interactive CLI Structure
```
VideoSummarizerCLI
├── InputValidation (scan folder, show files, confirm)
├── ConfigurationPrompts (Whisper model, scene detection, options)
├── BatchProcessor (uninterrupted processing loop)
│   ├── ProgressDisplay (real-time status, no user input)
│   ├── ErrorLogging (log and continue, no interruption)
│   └── ResultGeneration (per-video folders, transcript, frames)
├── CompletionSummary (success/failure counts, processing time)
├── ErrorReview (end-of-batch error handling only)
└── IndexGeneration (VIDEO_INDEX.md with duplicate flags)
```

### File Structure Validated
```
video-summarizer/
├── main.py                    # Interactive CLI entry point
├── input/                     # User drops videos here
├── output/                    # Per-video output folders
│   ├── {video-filename}/
│   │   ├── transcript.txt     # With metadata header
│   │   └── scene_*.png        # Extracted frames
├── VIDEO_INDEX.md             # Master index with ASCII tables
└── processing.log             # Detailed error logging
```

## Design Validation Results

### Interactive Conversation Outcomes
- **Architecture Alignment**: Confirmed interactive CLI approach over GUI/runbook
- **Error Handling**: Validated non-interrupting batch processing with end-of-batch error review
- **File Structure**: Confirmed `output/{video-filename}/` structure with transcript and frames together
- **Technology Stack**: Simple Python script with built-in libraries + tqdm for progress

### Key Design Decisions
- **User Intervention**: Only at start (setup/config) and end (results review)
- **Processing Philosophy**: Log errors and continue, never interrupt batch flow
- **Recovery Strategy**: Retry failed videos only without reprocessing successful ones
- **Marketing Team UX**: Simple start, walk away, review results when complete

### Success Criteria Met
✅ ASCII wireframes for interactive CLI interface created
✅ User flow diagrams showing complete interaction paths
✅ Component hierarchy and relationship mapping documented
✅ Error state and edge case flow documentation completed
✅ Stakeholder review and feedback integration achieved

## Technical Specifications Established

### CLI Interface Requirements
- **Monospace Display**: Clean ASCII progress bars and tables
- **Step-by-step Prompts**: Clear guided workflow for non-technical users
- **Real-time Progress**: Updates without user intervention during processing
- **Error Resilience**: Continue processing all videos despite individual failures

### Output Format Requirements
- **Per-video Folders**: Self-contained results in `output/{video-filename}/`
- **Transcript Format**: .txt files with metadata headers (processing quality indicators)
- **Frame Format**: High-quality PNG files with scene detection
- **Index Format**: .md file with ASCII tables for monospace readability

### Processing Flow Requirements
- **Non-interrupting**: Complete entire batch before error review
- **Duplicate Detection**: Flag potential duplicates in index and summary
- **Retry Capability**: Process failed videos only without reprocessing successful ones
- **Administrative Options**: History viewing, clean restart, detailed logging

## Next Phase Transition
ASCII wireframes and user flow design complete. Ready to proceed to Task 2.2: Interactive Mock using Tech Stack for hands-on validation of the interactive CLI design with working Python prototype.
