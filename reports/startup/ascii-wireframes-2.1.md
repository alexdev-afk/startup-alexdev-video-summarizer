# Task 2.1 Completion Report: ASCII Wireframes & User Flow Design

**Date**: 2025-09-04  
**Task**: ASCII Wireframes & User Flow Design  
**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED** - Simplified CLI interface wireframes with config-driven architecture  

---

## **Executive Summary**

Successfully designed CLI interface wireframes through iterative user feedback, evolving from comprehensive configuration interface to ultra-simplified "appliance" approach. Final design emphasizes ease-of-use over configurability, with all technical options externalized to configuration files.

**Key Achievement**: Transformed complex 7-tool pipeline interface into 3-screen workflow requiring minimal user decisions.

## **Wireframe Development Process**

### **Interactive Design Iteration**
- **v1 (comprehensive)**: Full configuration interface with tool toggles, processing modes, directory displays
- **v2 (simplified)**: Config-driven approach based on user feedback: "make the UI as simple as possible"

### **Key Design Evolution**
- **Removed from UI**: Tool configuration, processing modes, advanced options
- **Moved to config files**: All technical settings externalized to YAML
- **Simplified to**: 3 screens, 2-3 actions per screen, appliance-like operation

---

## **Final Interface Design (v2)**

### **Three-Screen Workflow**
1. **Launch**: Shows found videos, estimated time, single ENTER to start
2. **Processing**: Real-time progress with 5-stage pipeline view
3. **Complete**: Results summary with option to process more

### **Configuration Architecture**
- **config/processing.yaml**: All tool settings and processing parameters
- **config/paths.yaml**: Directory structure and file patterns
- **No UI configuration**: Everything pre-configured for optimal operation

---

## **User Experience Principles Applied**

### **Appliance Philosophy**
- **Single purpose**: Transform videos into searchable knowledge
- **Minimal decisions**: ENTER/Q/ESC only
- **Predictable workflow**: Same process every time
- **No setup burden**: Works out of the box

### **Progress Communication**
- **Time estimates**: Clear processing duration and remaining time
- **Current activity**: Human-readable status ("Conference room discussion")
- **Pipeline stages**: Simplified 5-stage view vs. complex 7-tool display

---

## **Quality Validation**

### **✅ Deliverables Complete**
- ASCII wireframes for all major interface components
- User flow documentation with complete interaction paths  
- Component hierarchy mapping (3-screen CLI structure)
- Error state and recovery flow specifications
- Stakeholder feedback integration (config externalization)

### **✅ Implementation Ready**
- Monospace formatting with Unicode box drawing characters
- Real-time progress update specifications
- Configuration system requirements defined
- Technical alignment with scene-based architecture

---

## **Success Criteria Met**

**✅ Complete UI validation** through iterative design with user feedback  
**✅ Simplified workflow** optimized for institutional knowledge creation  
**✅ Technical integration** aligned with 7-tool scene-based architecture  
**✅ Configuration externalization** enabling appliance-like operation  

---

## **Next Phase**

**Ready for Task 2.2**: Interactive mock using tech stack for hands-on validation of CLI interface concepts.

**Architecture Foundation**: User experience design supports maximum simplicity while maintaining visibility into scene-based processing pipeline.
