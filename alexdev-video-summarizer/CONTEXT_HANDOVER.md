‚úÖ RESOLVED: Source Tag Threading Fix in Audio Timeline Services

  üéØ Issue Summary

  All audio timeline services (Whisper, LibROSA, PyAudio) were showing hardcoded sources like "librosa" instead of dynamic source tags like "librosa_music", "whisper_voice", etc.

  üîç Root Cause Analysis

  **Simple Architecture Problem** (not complex as initially thought):
  - `generate_and_save()` receives `source_tag` parameter correctly
  - Internal methods that create events/spans used hardcoded sources
  - Solution: Thread `source_tag` through 4-5 methods per service

  ‚úÖ **Complete Solution Applied**

  **Fixed All Services with Parameter Threading:**
  - **Whisper Service**: Fixed in commit 218a249 ‚úÖ
  - **LibROSA Service**: Fixed in commit f467b7e ‚úÖ  
  - **PyAudio Service**: Fixed in commit f467b7e ‚úÖ

  **Architecture Pattern:**
  ```python
  # Before (hardcoded)
  source="librosa"
  
  # After (dynamic)
  source=source_tag
  ```

  **Changes Made:**
  - Thread `source_tag` parameter through all internal methods
  - Replace hardcoded `source="service"` with `source=source_tag`
  - Add assertions to ensure `source_tag` is provided
  - Fix enhanced methods, legacy methods, and mock/fallback methods
  - Remove post-processing approach entirely

  üß† **Key Architecture Learning**

  **User was correct to reject post-processing approach:**
  - ‚ùå Post-processing: Iterate through timeline after creation (wrong)
  - ‚úÖ Parameter threading: Pass source_tag to methods (correct)
  - Simple 4-5 method chain, not complex nested calls as initially claimed
  - Same pattern as Whisper service (architectural consistency)

  üöÄ **Verified Results**

  All services now generate correct dynamic source tags:
  - Whisper events: `"source": "whisper_voice"` ‚úÖ
  - LibROSA events: `"source": "librosa_music"` ‚úÖ
  - PyAudio events: `"source": "pyaudio_music"` / `"source": "pyaudio_voice"` ‚úÖ

  **Status: COMPLETE** - All timeline services fixed with proper parameter threading.
